# Customer-Product-Analysis

Hi this code is for "Customer Segmentation and Product Profitability Analysis"


You will find one .ipynb file which contains the code and 2 csv files of purchase behaviour of customers and transactions of the products. You need to load these datasets in the first cell of the code and rest would work automatically after running.
